I attended Anne Arundel Community College and Towson State University and graduated with a degree in Secondary Education. I am also a veteran, having served 6 years in the United States Army Reserves from 1967 to 1972, training to operate amphibious craft.</p><p>I began my teaching career at Southern Junior High School in September of 1972. Two years later I became Department Chairperson of the World Classical Language Department at Brooklyn Park Junior/Senior High School. When Brooklyn Park merged with Andover High School in 1990, I was chosen as the Chairperson of the World Classical Language Department. I am the only remaining original teacher at North County High School. In November of 2019 I was inducted into the North County Hall of Fame, the first class of people to be honored for their dedication to the school.</p></div><div class="col-md-12 col-xl-6"><p>During my teaching career I have also been involved in our sports programs. I was a basketball coach for 15 years, and I became the “Voice of the Bees” for Brooklyn Park High School and later the “Voice of the Knights” after we opened in 1990. As “Voice of the Knights” I announce football, basketball, lacrosse, soccer and other sports when needed, a job which I still enjoy.</p><p class="mb-md-5 mb-sm-5">For over 15 years I have also been the main TAAAC representative for the North County staff and I serve as the chairperson on the North County High School Faculty Council. The Faculty Council exists by contract as a group of teachers to meet with the principal on a monthly basis in order to advise the principal about any important school matters or concerns. Additionally, I serve on the TAAAC High School Concerns Committee, which meets monthly to discuss specific concerns for high schools, and I have been the chair of the committee for the past 5 years. Finally, I serve on the ASI-TAAAC Advisory Group which meets monthly with BOE staff to discuss high school concerns, particularly of an instructional nature. This is an important collaborative group that I have been honored to be a part of for over 5 years.</p></div><div class="col-md-12 col-xl-6 text-center"><img id="wof" src="img/wall-of-fame.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"></div></div></div></section><span class="anchor" id="issues"></span><section id="issues" class="page-section"><div class="container pb-0"><h1 class="section-heading">Where Do I Stand?</h1><div class="section-heading-divider bg-dark"></div></div><div class="container-fluid bg-primary text-center p-5 mb-5"><a class="text-light" href="/doc/covid_19_statement.pdf"><h2 class="mb-0">A Statement Regarding COVID-19</h2></a></div><div id="card-container" class="row container"><div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6 col-xl-4 d-flex align-items-stretch mb-5"><div class="card shadow p-3"><img src="img/clock.svg" class="card-img-top w-25 mx-auto mt-4"><div class="card-body"><h5 class="card-title text-center">Start Times</h5><p class="card-text">I have always made decisions based upon what is in the best interest of my students. The health and well being of our students are of utmost importance. Any decision I make will always be based on their well-being. As always, there must be communication and collaboration with all stakeholders, including the students we serve. I strongly recommend that all students be surveyed in order to give them the opportunity to voice their opinions and to express their concerns.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6 col-xl-4 d-flex align-items-stretch mb-5"><div class="card shadow p-3"><img src="img/shield.svg" class="card-img-top w-25 mx-auto mt-4"><div class="card-body"><h5 class="card-title text-center">Safety</h5><p class="card-text">All parents and guardians have the expectation that their children are safe in school. This must be one of our first priorities. Any investment we make in the safety of our students and staff is a good investment. We need to be proactive rather than reactive and we need to continue to find ways to guarantee the safety of everyone. Through positive collaboration and cooperation with one another, we can make a difference.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6 col-xl-4 d-flex align-items-stretch mb-5"><div class="card shadow p-3"><img src="img/books.svg" class="card-img-top w-25 mx-auto mt-4"><div class="card-body"><h5 class="card-title text-center">Curriculum</h5><p class="card-text">Students need to experience learning situations relevant to the world in which they live. Students in today’s world need to be able to actively participate in the learning experience and show us that they can apply the concepts they have learned. As a member of the Board of Education, I would like to see an increased level of communication between teachers and staff so that the curriculum our students experience will better prepare them for life after graduation.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6 col-xl-4 d-flex align-items-stretch mb-5"><div class="card shadow p-3"><img src="img/apple.svg" class="card-img-top w-25 mx-auto mt-4"><div class="card-body"><h5 class="card-title text-center">Staff Compensation</h5><p class="card-text">While I have been treated fairly in terms of step increases, pay increases and bonuses, the same cannot be said for many staff members in this county. It is the responsibility of all stakeholders to work together to make it happen. This requires a full and complete understanding of the impact of lost steps on all staff. As a member of the Board of Education I will advocate for fair and equitable compensation for all staff.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6 col-xl-4 d-flex align-items-stretch mb-5"><div class="card shadow p-3"><img src="img/brain.svg" class="card-img-top w-25 mx-auto mt-4"><div class="card-body"><h5 class="card-title text-center">Mental Health</h5><p class="card-text">For years I have advocated for additional staff to help our students who struggle with mental health concerns. We can be proactive in this area by providing all students access to mental health services through guidance counselors, PPW workers and social workers. We need to make sure that these services are provided to all students. As a member of the Board of Education, I will advocate for training for all so that everyone knows what to do when someone is in crisis.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6 col-xl-4 d-flex align-items-stretch mb-5"><div class="card shadow p-3"><img src="img/school.svg" class="card-img-top w-25 mx-auto mt-4"><div class="card-body"><h5 class="card-title text-center">Construction</h5><p class="card-text">We must continue to collaborate with the communities involved and the County Council and the County Executive as well as our local and state politicians to continue to plan for the future of Anne Arundel County Public Schools.
